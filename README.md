# NeuralNetwork
Playing around and trying to learn programming neural networks. This is an effort for me to understand some of the underlying architecture better
and learn how to use some of the libraries that are used in building them. I have linked all sources I have used for each notebook within them. You can also feel free
to use this as study material as I am writing notes as I go!

Currently working on Building a transformer neural network from scratch [here](Transformer/transformer_nn.ipynb).

Check out standard neural network from scratch [here](NN_from_scratch.ipynb)
